## First GitHub Page

#### My name is Trennon Talbot and this is my first GitHub Page. This page is hosted at ***[BSU-TrennonTalbot.github.io](https://tdinorock.github.io/BSU-TrennonTalbot.github.io/)***.

I am majoring in BSU's GIMM (Game, Interactive Media and Mobile) Program.  We learn to program code, create art and animations through digital media, create mobile apps, and play with augmented and virtual reality.  I have just completed my first year of this four year program.  It is both difficult and fun at the same time.  If you want to see a small snipit, check out my youtube channel where I upload my digital art, animations, and there are links to my program games in some of the descriptions: ***https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrfcgJY0Iw2I_Ynjfq0nA9A***.
