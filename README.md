First GitHub Page

My name is Trennon Talbot and this is my first GitHub Page.

I am majoring in BSU's GIMM (Game, Interactive Media and Mobile) Program.  We learn to program code, create art and animations through digital media, create mobile apps, and play with augmented and virtual reality.  I have just completed my first year of this four year program.  It is both difficult and fun at the same time.  If you want to see a small snipit, check out my youtube channel where I upload my digital art, animations, and there are links to my program games in some of the descriptions: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrfcgJY0Iw2I_Ynjfq0nA9A.

I also play online games and many outdoor games as well.  Yes, I touch grass.  I am also a black belt in Taekwondo.  I am a friendly guy that just loves to make people laugh.
